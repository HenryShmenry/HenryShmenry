# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HenryShmenry
Secretary for the Mathematics Society and 2nd year Mathematics Student at the University of York.
I have little to no knowledge about all things programming, though occasionally dabbled in Java, Lua & Python to create bots and games. 
My main focus at the moment, as described below in the "I'm currently learning" section, is Tex or LaTeX! 
Due to the nature of my course, knowing TeX has proven to be unbelievably beneficial when producing assignments & concocting notes for my modules.
Many of these notes can be found around my page here (If they should be helpful in any way whatsoever to you).

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in:
- Mathematics # Ghostbusters
    - Blender 4.0
      - Time Travel?
        - Lord of the Rings
          - Dr Who
            - Christmas Jumpers
              - Davinci Resolve 18.6.3
  
## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- In my course, my current modules are:
  - Metric Spaces 
  - Classical Dynamics
  - Vector & Complex Calculus
- What I'm learning outside my course:
  - How to USE GITHUB ðŸ˜¢
  - Blender Modelling
  - Quantum Mechanics (To be prepared for next year)
  - Business Management
